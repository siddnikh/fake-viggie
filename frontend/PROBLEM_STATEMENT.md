# DriveWise: AI-Powered Driving School Registration

## Problem Statement
Traditional driving school registration processes are often cumbersome and time-consuming. Students have to manually fill out lengthy forms, and there's limited assistance available during the registration process. This can lead to errors, incomplete applications, and a frustrating user experience.

## Solution: DriveWise
DriveWise aims to revolutionize the driving school registration process by integrating AI assistance directly into the application flow. The project combines a user-friendly multi-step form with an AI chatbot that can help users complete their registration efficiently.

## Current Implementation (Frontend)
- Multi-step registration form with 4 key sections:
  - Personal Information
  - Driving Experience
  - Preferences
  - Confirmation
- Modern, responsive UI using ShadcN components
- Progress tracking across form steps
- Form validation for required fields
- Interactive chatbot interface
- Voice command button (UI only)

## Planned AI Integration
The project is set up to integrate with AI capabilities:
- AI-powered form completion through chat
- Voice commands for hands-free form filling
- Intelligent response system for user queries
- Form validation and suggestions
- Real-time assistance during registration

## Technical Stack
- Next.js with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ShadcN UI components
- React for frontend interactivity

## Development Status
The frontend foundation is complete with:
- Working multi-step form structure
- Basic validation
- Chat interface
- Voice button UI

The AI integration points are prepared but not yet implemented:
- Chat functionality returns "Not implemented yet"
- Voice commands show placeholder responses
- Form-to-chat connection to be developed

## Next Steps
Developers can focus on:
1. Implementing AI chat functionality
2. Adding voice command processing
3. Creating the connection between chat/voice and form auto-fill
4. Enhancing validation with AI suggestions

The project provides the necessary frontend scaffolding for AI integration, allowing developers to focus on implementing the AI functionality rather than building the UI from scratch.
